#### Note for students using this repo:
Here are the files of my work during my Python class for MIDS. I published them here as a way to encourage self-development and learning. Please, do not copy this files as a full answer to your assignments. This is against Berkeley's code of conduct, highly unethical and the worst, you will not learn as intended.

Feel free to reach out to me with questions, suggestions and critics.

## Summary

This is a course that develops our soft skills around the Data Science realm. The discussion topics includes:

* Tactical and strategic decisions
* Impact of Data Science and policy implications
* Biases and fallacies
* How data science may (or may not) impact the scientific research
* Designing and reframing research questions
* Storytelling within data Science
* Data visualization
* Future of data science

In the repo, you will find my presentations and an article, all created as a form of reflexion of how data is used in news and media nowadays, and to discuss better forms of collect, transform, extract insights and visualize data.

Hope you have fun!
