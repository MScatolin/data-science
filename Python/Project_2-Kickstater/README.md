# Project 2 - W200 - Python for Data Science
### UC Berkeley - MIDS

#### Note for students using this repo:
Here are the files of my work during my Python class for MIDS. I published them here as a way to encourage self-development and learning. Please, do not copy this files as a full answer to your assignments. This is against Berkeley's code of conduct, highly unethical and the worst, you will not learn as intended.

Feel free to reach out to me with questions, suggestions and critics.

## Introduction

This project was the final project of my Python for Data Science Class, made together with two other classmates. This intends to cover our learning about pandas and graphical libraries for python. You will find our code and comments on the Jupyter notebook file attached. Note that the data source `merged.csv` was ommited due to the file size.

Thanks to my classmates Andres Kodaka and Sergio Ferro.

Hope you have fun!
