#### Note for students using this repo:
Here are the files of my work during my Python class for MIDS. I published them here as a way to encourage self-development and learning. Please, do not copy this files as a full answer to your assignments. This is against Berkeley's code of conduct, highly unethical and the worst, you will not learn as intended.

Feel free to reach out to me with questions, suggestions and critics.

## Introduction

This project was build to apply the concepts of object oriented programming in python. You will find to files, `what_if_this_was_a_farm.py` which implements three classes, its constructors and functions and a main file, that simulates a game where you can try to maximize your food production based on land grid. The code have all functions with their respective docstrings and other comments.

I hope you have fun!
